As an illustration of the dataset, for example, in the dataset named “experiment_index.cvs”. Each row is an Al-complex molecule catalyst. The first 56 molecules are the initial training data points. The column “yield” refers to Pm values. YR3_code and R1R2_code refer to the specific fragment of BnCp and Am, respectively in that Al-complex molecule. Temp_code and Ratio_code refer to the temperature and monomer/catalysts feed ratio in the reaction, both of which can be ignored because they are not relevant to Pm/Pr value prediction. The feature set is generated by expanding each of YR3_code and R1R2_code in terms of the descriptor vectors stored in files named like “YR3_dft.csv, R1R2_mordred.csv”, depending on which descriptor type is chosen, i.e. DFT/Mordred/CM/EI/OHE.
